## Client needs

### Home page

The homepage will show all **new and trending** video games.
You either add a **pagination** that shows a maximum amount of games, or create and **infinite** load.

You can select other categories that will display different games.

#### Must have categories:

- New releases
- Next week releases
- Best of the year (popular games)

The user can search for games by name and use filters.

**Filter one :**

- Date added
- Name
- Release date

**Filter two:**

- All platforms in the database.

Every game will be displayed inside a card, this card contains tiny details such as:

- Average score
- platforms
- title
- release date
- genres
- ...

Don't display all details just like that, make certain details appear when the user hovers over a card.
When the user selects a card, they get redirected to the game page.

## Game page

On this page the user will find all the details about the game, including trailers, screen-shots, ...  
Add to the page that what you think is important for the user to see.

The user still has access to the search-bar on this page to return to the homepage.

## Done?

Applications are never really finished. Try to come up with some extra features.
What about comparing games?
More categories?
Maybe your favorite games that get saved to the local storage and if it exists, shown on a favorite page?

All of these sound maybe complicated, but if you build your application correctly it should be easy to add new features.

## Now Mr(s). Developer, it's up to you.
